# Quizle Server

**Quizle Server** is a robust and scalable back-end application built with the **Ktor framework** in **Kotlin**. It's designed to power the Quizle platform, providing all the necessary functionality to manage and deliver quizzes and questions to users.

This project is built following a **Clean Architecture** approach with distinct Data, Domain, and Presentation layers, ensuring a highly maintainable.

### üìù Key Features


1.  **Quiz and Question Management**: A comprehensive API for all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on quizzes and their questions.
2.  **Secure Authentication**: Uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to protect API routes, ensuring that only authenticated users can manage quiz content.
3.  **MongoDB Integration**: Utilizes MongoDB for persistent and scalable data storage.
4.  **Cloud Storage**: Integrates with AWS S3 for scalable and reliable storage of quiz-related assets like images.
5.  **Clean Architecture**: The project is organized into three distinct layers to separate concerns: Presentation, Domain, and Data.
6.  **Dependency Injection**: The Koin framework is used to manage dependencies, improving code organization and testability.
7.  **Centralized Error Handling**: The Status Pages plugin provides consistent and clean API responses by handling exceptions centrally.
8.  **Comprehensive Logging**: The Call Logging plugin generates detailed logs of all client requests, which is crucial for monitoring and debugging.

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MamonAburawi/Quizle-Server.git
    ```

2.  **Configure Environment Variables**:
    Add your configurations for JWT, MONO_DB, and AWS in local variables in your IDLE

    ```properties
    # JWT Configuration
    JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_key
    JWT_ISSUER=your_app_domain
    JWT_AUDIENCE=your_app_domain
    JWT_REALM=your_realm
    JWT_EXPIREY=your_date_were_token_expire_in

    # AWS S3 Configuration
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key


    # MONGO DB Configuration
    MONGO_DB_URL=your_mongo_db_url
    
    ```

Here is the content of the `secret.conf` file to use for your setup.

```hocon
jwt {
    secret = ${?JWT_SECRET}
    issuer = ${?JWT_ISSUER}
    audience = ${?JWT_AUDIENCE}
    realm = ${?JWT_REALM}
    expiry = ${?JWT_TOKEN_EXPIRY}
}

aws {
     accessKey = ${?AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}
     secret = ${?AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}
}

mongo {
    url = ${?MONGO_DB_URL}
}

```

3.  **Build and Run the Server**:
    Once your dependencies are running, you can start the Ktor server.

    ```bash
    ./gradlew run
    ```

## API Endpoints

 The API is designed to manage quizzes and their questions. All endpoints will soon be secured with a valid JWT in the Authorization header.
## Quiz Question Endpoints

  * **`GET /quiz/questions?topicCode={topicCode}`**
      * Retrieves all quiz questions for a specific topic.
  * **`POST /quiz/questions`**
      * Creates or updates a single quiz question.
  * **`GET /quiz/questions/{id}`**
      * Retrieves a specific quiz question by its unique ID.
  * **`DELETE /quiz/questions/{id}`**
      * Deletes a quiz question using its unique ID.

      * Deletes a user's profile image using its URL.

### JSON Data Structure for User Profile Image

These endpoints do not use a JSON body for the image itself. The `POST` request uses `multipart/form-data`, and the `GET` and `DELETE` endpoints use a query parameter.

## Project Structure (Clean Architecture)

The project is divided into three distinct modules to enforce the dependency rule (**Presentation** ‚Üí **Domain** ‚Üí **Data**):

  * **presentation**: This layer contains the Ktor application, including all API endpoints, routes, and `ApplicationCall` handling. It depends only on the Domain Layer.
  * **domain**: This is the core of the application. It holds the business logic and use cases. This layer is independent of any frameworks and defines interfaces for data access (e.g., `QuizRepository` interfaces) but not their implementations.
  * **data**: This layer contains the implementations of the data sources. It is where the concrete logic for interacting with **MongoDB** and **AWS S3** resides, providing the actual data to the Domain Layer via the defined interfaces.
